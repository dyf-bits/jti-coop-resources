In this week, I continued to gain hands-on experience in various carpentry tasks. My main focus was on assisting the carpenters at the company with a residential renovation project.

= Key Tasks and Activities

+ Assisted in installing drywall in a renovated room, ensuring proper joint alignment and taping.
+ Helped build a deck for a new home, including cutting and assembling the frame and boards.
+ Participated in a safety meeting, which discussed the importance of proper ladder usage and fall protection.

= Skills and Knowledge Gained:
- Improved my understanding of drywall installation techniques and best practices.
- Developed my deck building skills, including measuring, cutting, and assembling deck components.

= Challenges and Areas for Improvement:
I struggled with accurately measuring and cutting deck boards, resulting in some wasted material. I will focus on improving my measurement skills to minimize waste
