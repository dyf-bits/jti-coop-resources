# Typst Templates for Co-op Reports
In this repository, you can find typst templates for coop weekly and final reports. These are intended for Jubail Technical Institute (JTI) student doing their coop, who prefer to use typst over MS Word.

The templates can be found in the `src/` directory.

If you want to compile both reports, run this command (assuming you have typst installed): 

```
make
```

You can also compile the reports individually:

```
make weekly
make final
```

The resulting PDFs will be available in the `out/` directory. I kept the compiled PDFs in this directory for viewing.

It is best to make a backup copy of the templates before editing, so you always have the originals to fall back to.

The templates are organized so that the information you should fill up/modify are at the top of the file. The bottom portion is dedicated for formatting.
